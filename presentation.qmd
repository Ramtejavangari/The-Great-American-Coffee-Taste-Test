# Why Coffee Dataset?

## 

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   NIH Survey stats: 75% of adults in USA drink coffee. Almost 50% drink it on daily basis. 
-   Coffee is a significant part of American Culture and Daily life. 
-   Widespread prevalence of coffee consumption makes it an ideal subject for data analysis.
-   It offers insights into behaviour patterns that affect a large portion of population.

## First Question

Why do people drink coffee, where do they drink it, what is their roast preference, and how much do they spend on it?

## Code 1

`{#} # coffee_survey <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-05-14/coffee_survey.csv')`

```{r}
coffee_survey <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-05-14/coffee_survey.csv')


coffee_Q1 <- coffee_survey[, c("why_drink", "roast_level", "total_spend", "where_drink")]
# 
coffee_Q1 <- coffee_survey[, c("why_drink", "roast_level", "total_spend", "where_drink")]
# 
# 
na.omit(coffee_Q1)
# 
# 
 coffee_Q1 <- na.omit(coffee_Q1[, c("why_drink", "roast_level", "total_spend", "where_drink")])










```

## Plot Text

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Most popular reason : “Tastes_good” (94%).

-   Caffeine (56%)  Ritual (54%) 

-   The least common “To Poop” (13%) 

-   Roast Preference” consistent across  reasons.

-   Light” roast - most popular (\~50%) and “Dark” Roast least popular (\~10%). 

-   Dark Roast for “To_poop”(13%).

## Plot Text

:::: columns

-   **Majority of people drink coffee at home.**

-   **most common spending range across all locations is (\$20-\$60)**

-   **Lowest spending range(\<\$20) and highest (\>\$100) have fewer people across all locations.**

-   **Surprisingly the “at home” category has maximum number of people spending \>\$100 for coffee.**

-   **Possible Reasons: Frequent Consumption,  Premium Coffee Beans, or  Data Bias .**

# Second Question

## How do age and gender impact preferences for various types of coffee and the use of additives?

-   **Regular drip coffee is the most favored across all ages, particularly among older individuals aged 55-64**

<!-- -->

-   **Younger generation prefer blended drinks, like Frappuccino**

<!-- -->

-   **Espresso and Latte show balanced appeal across a wide age range**

<!-- -->

-   **Cold brew, Cortado and Americano are less preferred, with modest popularity in the middle-aged demographic**

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
